This folder is just a few pages of stack overflow's top "python" tagged questions.  

These are here for if you aren't connected to the internet, 
or just don't want to just keep scraping the data. 

You can move these into the `nbs/data/raw` directory from root if you're having trouble
getting the data, using the following command:

`mv backup/* nbs/data/raw`
